# 👋 Hi, I'm Neelam Manikanta Naidu

**`Cyber Security Student | ECE Background | Ethical Hacker`**

"Exploring the unseen side of technology — securing the future, one system at a time."

I'm a passionate Cyber Security student in my 3rd year of B.Tech. With a strong foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), I blend hardware intelligence with cyber awareness — connecting circuits and code to create secure, smart solutions. I believe in "learning by breaking and rebuilding," exploring vulnerabilities to strengthen them, and transforming curiosity into secure technology.

My goal is to become a **Professional Ethical Hacker & IoT Security Expert**, protecting digital environments and empowering safe innovation.
